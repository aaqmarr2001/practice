      <h1>Tropical Cyclone</h1>

<p>A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center,
  a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain and/or squalls.</p>

<p>Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including:
  , , , ,  or . </p>

  <ul>
    <li>hurricane</li>
    <li>typhoon</li>
    <li>tropical storm</li>
    <li>cyclonic storm</li>
    <li>tropical depression</li>
    <li>cyclone</li>
  </ul>

<p>A hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean;
  in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean, comparable storms are referred to simply as "tropical cyclones" or "severe cyclonic storms."</p>

  <h2>Structure</h2>

  <h3>Eye and Center</h3>

  <p>At the center of a mature tropical cyclone, air sinks rather than rises.
    For a sufficiently strong storm, air may sink over a layer deep enough to suppress cloud formation, thereby creating a clear "eye".
    Weather in the eye is normally calm and free of convective clouds, although the sea may be extremely violent.
    The eye is normally circular and is typically 30–65 km (19–40 mi) in diameter, though eyes as small as 3 km (1.9 mi) and as large as 3
    70 km (230 mi) have been observed.</p>

<h3>  Movement</h3>

  <p>The movement of a tropical cyclone (i.e. its "track") is typically approximated as the sum of two terms:
     "steering" by the background environmental wind and "beta drift".</p>

  <h3>Size</h3>

  <p>There are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size.
    The most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind (i.e. gale force), the radius of outermost closed isobar (ROCI),
     and the radius of vanishing wind.</p>
